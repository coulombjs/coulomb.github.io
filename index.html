    CoulombJS is a framework that aims to simplify
    the development of applications that:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on data entry and management
      <li>Deliver custom-tailored user interface appropriate to problem domain
      <li>Under the hood, use a structured format such as YAML to store data
      <li>Version data using Git
      <li>May be used in a potentially collaborative way
      <li>Support macOS, Windows and Linux from a single codebase
      <li>Do not require the end user to install other dependencies
    </ul>

    <p>
    Among notable use cases for such applications
    are content management systems for statically generated websites
    and applications for managing enterprise datasets.

    CoulombJS is built on top of Electron,
    uses TypeScript as primary development language,
    React components as UI building blocks
    (with Blueprint as a default component library),
    and Isomorphic Git for working with Git repositories dependency-free.
